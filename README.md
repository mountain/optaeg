# optaeg: a test fields to combine neural networks and Arithmetic Expression Geometry

We tried different ways to combine neural networks and Arithmetic Expression Geometry and test them on different datasets.
Several models showed very good results with extremely less parameters:
- OptAEGV3 with only 702 parameters to reach 98.2% accuracy on MNIST

So here is a repository to share our work and results.
