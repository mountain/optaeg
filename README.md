# optaeg: combine neural networks and AEG theory

We tried different ways to combine neural networks and Arithmetic Expression Geometry and test them on different datasets.
Several models showed very good results with extremely less parameters:
- OptAEGV3 with only 702 parameters to reach 98.2% accuracy on MNIST
- OptAEGV3 and SemiLinear combined with only 9.7k parameters to reach 90.7% accuracy on FashionMNIST
